                    Taking a moment to look around, you see the library is surrounded by a small garden. 
                    The plants are withered and dying, the grass is brown and brittle. 
                    The air is thick with the smell of decay. This place meant a great deal to Paige. <br> <br>
                    Now, however, it is a place of darkness and despair. Covered in the 'Ill Ink', the library is a shadow of its former self.
